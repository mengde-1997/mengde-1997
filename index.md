## On-going Project 
AI-CNN SoC IC Design<br />
* Description<br />
Convolution neural network is very helpful for Computer Vision, or Pattern Recognition, of AI technology.<br />
I am going to design a 8051-MCU core, and later on a circuit with an optimized Convolution Neural Network (CNN) IP, for at least the 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 image filter operation, and integrate the CNN IP and MCU core in FPGA, which will be a critical IP for AI or Pattern recognition systems.<br />
* Deliverables<br />
Using Verilog/SystemVerilog RTL to develop the CNN IP core, a Microcontroller Unit (MCU), in the form of 8051, and later on combining all these IPs together, in FPGA. If time is allowed, will further develop the integrated IP, in IC level.<br />
Develop a verification testbench to validate the design with any benchmark image suite.<br />
Deliver a Synthesizable RTL design which is generated by Synopsys DC compiler or Xilinx Vivado Design Suite with timing constraints.<br />
## Language & Skills
* IELTS：6.5<br />
* CET-6：560<br />
* Basic knowledge of Linux&Unix,Cshell and VIM
* Programming: Systemverilog, Verilog, C, Python, Matlab and is learing perl and tcl now<br />
