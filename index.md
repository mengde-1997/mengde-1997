# Welcome to My Homepage !

I'm MENG DE and a Msc student of HongKong University majored in Electrical and Electronic Engineering now.
My research interests include analog&digital IC design,smart sensors and computer architecture（especially AI core).
And I am looking for a RA/phd position in these fields.







## Education Background
* _02/11/2020_, We open source an unofficial source code ([link here](https://github.com/zhutmost/lsq-net)) on low-bitwidth quantization schemem for DNNs ([LSQ @ ICLR2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08153)). It achieves the same FP32 accurracy on ResNet with 3b activation/weight quantization. (Benchmark: ImageNet)
* _11/12/2019_, Chixiao co-authored paper "XNORAM: A Binary CiM Architecture with Flexbile Data Flow Mappying" is accepted by AICAS 2020.
* _08/18/2019_, Chixiao's proposal: Sensing-Computution-Memory-in-one Circuits and Systems design is approved and sponsored by NSFC (国家自然科学基金-面上项目).
